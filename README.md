> We are preparing our first major release 1.0.0. It's already available in [beta1](https://github.com/Danil0v3s/CleanMeter/releases/tag/1.0.0.beta-1) and it makes our app completely standalone, without the need of HWiNFO or MSI Afterburner anymore. Try it out and let us know!

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We released 0.0.4 which DROPPED the need of MSI Afterburner and rely entirely on HWInfo alone. We heard some of you dislike Afterburner so we opted to go the least friction route.

## What is this?

A small desktop companion app to display sleek graphs overlays from HWInfo. Designs were made by [/u/Violetmars](https://www.reddit.com/user/Violetmars/)

## Getting started
1. If you have HWiNFO installed already, make sure that `Enable Shared Memory Support` is **enabled** at the settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you chose to have HWiNFO installed, _**you**_ will have to manage the `Shared Memory Support` limitation of 12 hours. Every 12 hours of uptime you will need to re-enable the setting. It seems the timer resets if you shutdown your computer before 12h uptime.
2. If you didn't have HWiNFO installed, there's no need to do any additional setup. (We manage a portable version of it ourselves)
3. Download the latest release, run it

## Current Limitations
- Doesn't work with exclusive fullscreen
