> ðŸŽ‰ <strong>We've released 1.0!</strong> Star this repo or keep an eye on it to follow along.

CleanMeter is the first gamer oriented clean statistics tracker, no fuss no muss, dead simple setup and good looking visuals.

### Benefits over traditional performance trackers
- This looks good
- No fluorescent numbers with Arial 12
- Doesn't mess with your power profile or fan setup

### Current Limitations
- Doesn't work with exclusive fullscreen
- Given our mission is to look _good_ and _clean_ at the same time, we might hold on to release new features because we need time to think how to accommodate our UI. We can't just enable every possible sensor, sorry.
